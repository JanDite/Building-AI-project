Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to combat counterfeit currency by training a machine learning model to distinguish genuine from forged banknotes. It analyzes features extracted from banknote images to build an accurate and reliable classification system.


## Background


The main goal of the bank note authentication project on Kaggle is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify banknotes as genuine or counterfeit. This involves:

Training the model using the provided dataset containing features extracted from genuine and forged banknotes.
Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to assess its ability to generalize effectively.
(Optional) Optimizing the model for accuracy, speed, or other relevant factors depending on the specific application.

## How is it used?

Ultimately, the goal is to create a model that can be used in real-world scenarios to reliably identify counterfeit banknotes, potentially aiding financial institutions or other organizations in combating fraud.
